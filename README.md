FileXchange
===========

FileXchange offers a way for iOS apps to send multiple files to each other. It uses the "Open In..." feature of iOS to hand over a list of the files and information on how to retrieve them from the sender.

Transfers and communication are done using Robbie Hanson's CocoaHTTPServer class.
